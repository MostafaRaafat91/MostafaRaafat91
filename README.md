### 🧪 **AI-Powered Testing**
```javascript
// Let AI write and execute tests naturally
"Test the login flow with invalid credentials and verify error messages"
```

### 📊 **Data Collection**
```javascript
// Automated data extraction from complex SPAs
"Navigate to the dashboard, extract all user metrics, and save as JSON"
```

### 🔍 **Quality Assurance**
```javascript
// Visual regression testing with AI assistance
"Compare the current homepage with the baseline and highlight differences"
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Web Testing

```javascript
// Launch a browser
const browser = await launchBrowser({ browserType: 'chromium', headless: true });

// Create a new page
const page = await newPage({ browserId: browser.id, url: 'https://example.com' });

// Take a screenshot
await screenshot({ pageId: page.id, path: 'example.png' });

// Click on an element
await click({ pageId: page.id, selector: 'button#submit' });

// Type text
await typeText({ pageId: page.id, selector: 'input[name="email"]', text: 'test@example.com' });

// Get text content
const text = await getText({ pageId: page.id, selector: 'h1' });
```

### Running Tests

Run the included Playwright tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in headed mode (visible browser)
npm run test:headed

# Debug tests
npm run test:debug
```

## Development

### Watch Mode
For development with automatic restarts:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Adding New Tools
To add new MCP tools, edit `src/index.js` and:

1. Add the tool definition to the `tools` array in `ListToolsRequestSchema` handler
2. Add a case in the `CallToolRequestSchema` handler
3. Implement the tool method in the `PlaywrightMCPServer` class

## Environment Variables

- `PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS`: Set to `false` to run browsers in headed mode
- `PLAYWRIGHT_SLOWMO`: Add delay between operations (milliseconds)

## Docker Environment

The Docker container includes:
- Node.js 18
- All Playwright browsers pre-installed
- System dependencies for browser operation
- Optimized for headless operation

## Troubleshooting

### Browser Installation Issues
```bash
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

### Permission Issues (Linux/Docker)
```bash
# Add to Dockerfile if needed
RUN groupadd -r pwuser && useradd -r -g pwuser -G audio,video pwuser
USER pwuser
```

### Memory Issues
For large-scale testing, increase Docker memory limits:
```bash
docker run --memory=2g --cpus=2 mcp-playwright
```
